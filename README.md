# Colab IClojure

This Repo has some templates that will allow you to run Clojure code on [Google Colaboratory](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/welcome.ipynb)

It uses [IClojure](https://github.com/HCADatalab/IClojure) as the Jupyter kernel

## Instructions

This is a two step process, there is no automated way to do this so far. The first step is to install the Clojure kernel. The next step is to upload a notebook and connect to the kernel runtime.

## Install the Clojure Kernel

1. Go to the Colaboratory and hit *File/upload-notebook*  - Either copy the `install_iclojure.ipynb` directly or use this [github link](https://github.com/gigasquid/colab-iclojure/blob/master/install_iclojure.ipynb)
1. Execute all the cells, one by one
